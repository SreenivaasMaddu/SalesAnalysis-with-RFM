RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a popular technique used in marketing and 
sales to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. It helps businesses identify
and prioritize their most valuable customers and develop targeted marketing strategies. 
RFM analysis considers three key factors:

Recency (R): This refers to the time elapsed since a customer's last purchase. Customers who 
have made recent purchases are more likely to be engaged and receptive to further marketing efforts.

Frequency (F): This indicates the number of times a customer has made purchases within a specific period. 
Customers with a higher frequency of purchases are considered more loyal and valuable to the business.

Monetary value (M): This represents the total amount of money a customer has spent on purchases. 
Customers with higher monetary values are generally more profitable for the business.

By analyzing these three factors together, businesses can segment their customer base into distinct 
groups and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly. Here's a general process for conducting RFM analysis:

Data collection: Gather transactional data that includes customer purchase history, 
such as dates of purchase, order values, and customer IDs.

Calculation: Assign scores or rankings to each customer based on their recency, frequency,
and monetary values. For example, rank customers from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest, 
based on recency (e.g., recent purchases within the last month would be assigned a score of 5).

Segmentation: Group customers based on their RFM scores. For example, you can have segments 
like "High-Value Customers" (high scores in all three factors), "Potential Loyal Customers"
(high frequency and monetary value but lower recency), or "Inactive Customers" (low scores in all three factors).

Analysis: Analyze each segment to understand their behavior, preferences, and characteristics. 
Identify trends and patterns that can guide marketing strategies.

Action: Develop targeted marketing campaigns or initiatives for each customer segment. For example, 
you might want to send exclusive offers to high-value customers to encourage repeat purchases 
or re-engage with inactive customers by providing special discounts.

Evaluation: Measure the effectiveness of your marketing strategies by monitoring the response 
and conversion rates of each segment. Adjust and refine your approaches as needed.
